## Objective  
Develop a scalable machine learning pipeline using Apache Spark to detect faults in wind turbines based on SCADA data.  

## Methods  
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Utilized Spark SQL and MLlib for efficient data handling and feature extraction.  
- **Model Training**: Implemented various models, including Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and Logistic Regression, to identify potential faults.  
- **Scalability Testing**: Evaluated the pipeline's performance with large datasets to ensure robustness and efficiency.
