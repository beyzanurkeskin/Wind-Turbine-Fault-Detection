## Objective  
Develop a scalable machine learning pipeline using Apache Spark to detect faults in wind turbines based on SCADA data.  

## Data
You can download the SCADA dataset from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azizkasimov/wind-turbine-scada-data-for-early-fault-detection

## Methods  
- **Model Training**: Implemented various models, including Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and Logistic Regression, to identify potential faults.  
- **Scalability Testing**: Evaluated the pipeline's performance with large datasets to ensure robustness and efficiency.
