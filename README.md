## Objective
Build a Spark-based ML pipeline to detect faults in wind turbines using SCADA data.  

## Methods
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering using Spark SQL and MLlib.  
- Model training: Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression.  
- Scalability testing with large datasets.  

## Outcome
A scalable fault detection pipeline and insights for predictive maintenance.
